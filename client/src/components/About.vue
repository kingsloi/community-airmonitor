                    <p>In September 2019, a foul odor rolled through the Miller Beach neighbourhood of Gary IN, causing many residents to experience eye irritation, headaches, and nausea. This came a month after a local steel mill had <a href="https://www.in.gov/idem/cleanwater/2576.htm" target="_blank">exceeded the daily maximum allowance of cyanide and ammonia-nitrogen</a>, releasing a <a href="https://echo.epa.gov/detailed-facility-report?fid=110000607558" target="_blank">considerable amount</a> of both chemicals into a tributary of Lake Michigan which went <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/08/20/arcelormittal-spill-indiana-state/" target="_blank">unreported for days</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/in/arcelormittal-burns-harbor-llc-portage-indiana" target="_blank">killing 1000s</a> of fish, <a href="https://apnews.com/bd9de73946954208b93cf5c9406c83c7" target="_blank">restricting intake</a> of a water filtration plant, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/08/19/cyanide-steel-plant-trickled-into-lake-michigan-days-before-public-was-notified/" target="_blank">closing local beaches</a>, and portions of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/news/chemical-spill-indu-20190814.htm">Indiana Dunes National Park</a>.

                    <p>Suspected the source was likely from one of the many mills/refineries in the region but with no data to support it, a handful of neighbours purchased a <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/collections/air-quality-sensors/products/purpleair-pa-ii" target="_blank">PurpleAir PA II Air Quality Sensor</a> to check the air quality in their neighbourhood in realtime, bringing awareness to how the local industry affects the air that residents and tourists of Miller Beach, Gary, &amp; Northwest Indiana breathe.</p>

                    <p>By tracking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index" role="button" target="_blank">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a>, measuring both <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics#PM" role="button" target="_blank">PM2.5 and PM10</a> particles, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, cloud coverage, UV index, etc. to determine how the weather and local industry affects the local air quality.</p>

                    <p>There are plenty of other pollutants in the air not being tracked, such as SO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, CO, to name a few. As soon as affordable ways of tracking these pollutants in our neighbourhood are available, they'll be tracked add it to our data.</p>

These exceedances appear to be the cause or a significant contributing factor to the mortality of the fish observed on the East Arm of the Little Calumet River. IDEM has requested that the facility initiate a spill response along with increased monitoring of its outfalls to the Little Calumet River. IDEM and DNR ask residents to continue to avoid this area while cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing.</blockquote>`
