These exceedances appear to be the cause or a significant contributing factor to the mortality of the fish observed on the East Arm of the Little Calumet River. IDEM has requested that the facility initiate a spill response along with increased monitoring of its outfalls to the Little Calumet River. IDEM and DNR ask residents to continue to avoid this area while cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing.</blockquote>`
