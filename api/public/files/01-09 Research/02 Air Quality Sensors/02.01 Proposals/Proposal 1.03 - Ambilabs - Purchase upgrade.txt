Hi Kingsley, you would be better off purchasing if running for a year or more.

Note that if you rent for 3 mths to trial it out, you can apply 50% of the rental pricing towards purchase price.

Being a local non-profit, what I could do is get permission to enable you to apply 100% of the rental pricing towards purchaseâ€¦ that way you get to trial it first, then buy it as long as its working well for you and you decide to commit to longer term monitoring
