# Community Air Monitor
>>> Tracking PM2.5/PM10 via a Purple Air Sensor, weather, traffic congestion, trains schedules, and more, in the [Miller Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Beach) neighbourhood of [Gary, IN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary,_Indiana).

In August 2019, [ArcelorMittal dumped cyanide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/08/19/cyanide-steel-plant-trickled-into-lake-michigan-days-before-public-was-notified/) closing the beaches along Lake Michigan. A few months later in October 2019, neighbours reported a foul odour that was causing nausea, headaches, and eye irritation. Northwest Indiana is described as housing "the largest steelmaking complex in North America" with:

 - BP Whiting Refinery
 - U.S. Steel's East Chicago Tin
 - ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor in East Chicago
 - Gary Works, the largest individual steel mill in the country

all within 15 miles of Gary, IN. Suspecting the foul odor was caused by one of the many mills in the region, a handful of residents of Miller Beach, crowd-funded a [Purple Air PA-II](https://www2.purpleair.com/collections/air-quality-sensors/products/purpleair-pa-ii) air sensor to track their air quality. Pulling in other sources of pollutants such as car congestion, train traffic, mill train traffic/coal/fuel/steel deliveries, flights overhead, tanker traffic in Lake Michigan, etc., we may be able to determine who, where, and how is impacting the air we breathe.
